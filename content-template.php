        <p class="paragraph-edit">Astute Inc. is focused on creating technologically savvy devices within the healthcare industry.  With a rapidly expanding and aging global population, they are looking to make an impact with instruments commonly used by their target demographic.  Astuteâ€™s overall objective is to create patient monitoring solutions that not only improve patient outcomes, but also lower the cost of providing healthcare.</p>
        <p class="paragraph-edit">Artinian Gems facilitates upscale gem shows at brick and mortar stores across the United States.   Their events combine fine stones, jewelry, and an opportunity for networking.  One of the biggest focuses of Artinian Gems is to support the host location with marketing upcoming events.  In supporting these locations, it allows their business to leverage existing relationships and expand the reach of their international brand.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-edit">The research and development team of Astute has put together a suite of offerings that includes physical monitoring devices, cellular services, cloud solutions, and data reporting.  Their flagship product, the Astute Health Hub, integrates these offerings to provide a robust patient monitoring solution.  The device is relatively affordable and eliminates the high installation costs that come with similar products.  Astute Inc. continuously pushes the envelope for the integration of medical tools and emerging technologies.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-edit">The leadership of Artinian Gems has created a foundation for how their gem shows are to be carried out.  However, in an effort to become more efficient, they would like to automate a large portion of this process via an online portal.  Artinian Gems would also like to create two e-commerce websites aimed at their main demographics, one for B2B (jewelry stores) and the other for B2C (the end consumer).  They hope to create a scalable online presence that correctly encapsulates their story and brand messaging.</p>
