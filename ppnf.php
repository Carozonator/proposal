				<h3 style="display:inline-block; border:none;">Our Multidisciplinary Approach</h3>
				<p>PPNF is seeking a brand-marketing relationship to conceptualize a new look and feel for their company and develop a custom strategic plan catered towards their business objectives.  BMS is positioned to assist PPNF with its ongoing growth requirements. First, BMS will need to conduct a thorough discovery to identify their goals and objectives for the project. In collaboration between both parties, this process will lay the groundwork for a brand that is both modernized and more competitive. </p>
				<p>As the project progresses, BMS will work alongside PPNF to help align initial expectations and deliver assets that match the project’s requirements.</p>

				<h3 style="display:inline-block; border:none;">I. Discovery & Strategic Direction</h3>
				<p>BMS will conduct a comprehensive discovery to understand PPNF’s objectives, market strategy, future goals, and specific needs. The following action items are included within the discovery portion of the project:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Complete research necessary to understand the client’s goals for their online presence at http://ppnf.org/ </li>
					<li>Extensive research and due diligence will be required to fully understand PPNF’s industry, competitors, and unique value proposition.</li>
					<li>BMS will do an audit of all resources PPNF currently has in order to determine how to best leverage and then improve upon these assets.</li>

				<h3 style="display:inline-block; border:none;">II. Branding Process</h3>
				<p>PPNF’s brand will be the foundation for all future assets created. Under the BMS branding process, a brand is meant to be an intellectual conversation between the design and the external observer.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>BMS will come up with three black and white concepts that have both real world and subconscious references. </li>
					<li>After a single concept is approved, then the typography as well as primary and secondary colors will be finalized.</li>
					<li>A branding guide will be developed in an effort to outline how the brand is to be utilized across any medium.</li>
					<li>Also included with the branding package is a designed letterhead and business card template.</li>

				<h3 style="display:inline-block; border:none;">III. Design & Creative</h3>
				<p>The PPNF brand as applied to the strategic plan will be the strongest example of how the newly created brand should be leveraged moving forward. It is helpful if PPNF is able to provide all current design assets and any branding/style guide that may exist.  Under our creative process, we believe an effective design is meant to be a multi-layered interaction between the graphic asset and a consumer. Therefore, BMS will strive to create an emotional and business connection between the clients target market and the design and messaging of the newly created brand.</p>
