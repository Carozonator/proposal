                    <h3>Paul Mcmahon <span>// Jr. Web Developer</span></h3>
                    <p>While growing up playing baseball in the streets of his cul-de-sac, the coming of technology seemed as extraneous to Paul, as the fact that technology would end up becoming a primary influence within his life. That is until his family got their first computer. Then all bets were off and anything was possible. With the world at his fingertips, Paul recognizes his interest and endless opportunity within the complex network of computer technology. Fast-forwarding many years, Mr. McMahon continued to pursue his interest in computer technology earning a degree in Cognitive Sciences at the University of California at San Diego. As a junior web developer at BMS, Mr. McMahon concentrates on providing a unique human experience through seamless code and website creation from scratch. Paul’s greatest pleasure is the pursuit of something better. Constantly improving his abilities, he works to produce the highest level of invention possible on anything that crosses his screen. That is one thing that will never change.</p>
