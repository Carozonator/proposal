					<h3>Paul McMahon <span>// Jr. Web Developer</span></h3>
					<p>While growing up playing baseball in the streets of his cul-de-sac, the coming of technology seemed as extraneous to Paul, as the fact that technology would end up becoming a primary influence within his life.

With the world at his fingertips, Paul recognizes his interest and endless opportunity within the complex network of computer technology. Fast-forwarding many years, Mr. McMahon continued to pursue his interest in computer technology earning a degree in Cognitive Sciences at the University of California at San Diego. As a junior web developer at BMS, Mr. McMahon concentrates on providing a unique human experience through seamless code and website creation from scratch.
